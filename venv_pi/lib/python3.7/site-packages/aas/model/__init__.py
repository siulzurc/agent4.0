"""
This package contains a python implementation of the meta-model of the AssetAdministrationShell.
The model is divided into 5 modules, splitting it where it in sensible parts. However, all classes (except for the
specialized Concept Descriptions) are imported into this top-level package, for simple imports like

    from aas.model import AssetAdministrationShell, Asset, Submodel, Property

The different modules are:

aas.py
    The main module, implementing high-level structures, such as AssetAdministrationShell, Asset and ConceptDictionary.

base.py
    Basic structures of the model, including all abstract classes and enumerations. This provides inheritance for the
    higher level structures.

provider.py
    Providers for AAS objects, in order to store and retrieve identifiable objects by their Identifier.

security.py
    Security model of the AAS. Currently not existing.

submodel.py
    Meta-model of the submodels and events.
