# Agent4.0 (A4.0)
Source files for the Agent 4.0 and the MARIANNE architecture on Python with PADE.

# Further notes
For the implementation of MARIANNE use PADE(https://pade.readthedocs.io/) and NOVAAS(https://gitlab.com/gidouninova/novaas).

Python 3.7+ is recommended for running the python scripts.

For creating the AASX file, the AASX explorer(https://github.com/admin-shell-io/aasx-package-explorer/releases/tag/v2020-11-16.alpha) is used. 

# Scientific Paper
Scientific papers (still in the peer-review process) present MARIANNE as an agent-based architecture for Industry 4.0, focusing on Cyber-Physical Production Systems.
